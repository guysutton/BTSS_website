The target plants have not yet had biocontrol agents released on
them and were ranked in order of priority to determine which species are most suitable for
biocontrol.

This prioritisation project is intended to be updated with any new relevant information. If
you would like to have any of the scoring or information updated please contact: Kim Canavan (K.Canavan@ru.ac.za).
