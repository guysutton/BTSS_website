      "contents": "\r\nSupplementary Table S1: The Biological Control Target Selection (BCTS) system was applied to 299 target alien plants listed on the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act (NEMBA) in South Africa. The target plants have not yet had biocontrol agents released on them and were ranked in order of priority to determine which species are most suitable for biocontrol.\r\nThis prioritisation project is intended to be updated with any new relevant information. If you would like to have any of the scoring or information updated please contact: Kim Canavan (K.Canavan@ru.ac.za).\r\nLast updated: 01 March, 2021\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nThe BCTS system was established to help prioritise weed targets in South Africa for biocontrol. For information on the development and application of the system see papers below:\r\nPaper 1, Downey et al. 2021  - Prioritisation of targets for weed biological control I:\r\nA review of existing prioritisation schemes and development of a system for South Africa. This paper identified and reviewed twelve previous systems developed to prioritise plant targets for biocontrol. This review streamlined the development and testing of the BCTS system in South Africa.\r\nPaper 2, Paterson et al. 2021  - Prioritisation of targets for weed biological control II:\r\nThe South African Biological Control Target Selection System. This paper outlined the BCTS system. The BCTS is built of the previous systems and uses thirteen attributes to present the highest predictive powers to rank potential target plants as biocontrol targets.\r\nPaper 3, Canavan et al. 2021  - Prioritisation of targets for weed biological control III:\r\nA tool to identify the next targets for biological control in South Africa and set priorities for resource allocation. This paper applies the BCTS to 299 target plants listed on the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act (NEMBA) in South Africa. A list of top priorities species are presented that represent good investments for biocontrol when funds are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
